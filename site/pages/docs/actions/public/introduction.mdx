# Introduction to Public Actions

A Public Action is an action that corresponds one-to-one with a public Conflux Core Space RPC method. They are used with a [Public Client](/docs/clients/public)

Public Actions do not require any special permissions nor do they provide signing capabilities to the user.

Public Actions provide a simple and secure way to access public data on the Conflux blockchain. They are widely used by dapps and other applications that need to retrieve information about transactions, accounts, blocks and other data on the network.
