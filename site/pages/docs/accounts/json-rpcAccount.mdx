# JSON-RPC Account

A JSON-RPC Account is an Account whose signing keys are stored on the external Wallet. It **defers** signing of transactions & messages to the target Wallet over JSON-RPC.

## Usage

A JSON-RPC Account can just be initialized as an [Address](#TODO) string, In the usage below, we are extracting the address from a Browser Extension Wallet (e.g. Fluent) with the `window.fluent` Provider via `cfx_chainId`:

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import "cive/window";
import { createWalletClient, custom } from "cive";
import { mainnet } from "cive/chains";

const [address] = await window.fluent.request({
  // [!code focus:3]
  method: "cfx_requestAccounts",
});

const client = createWalletClient({
  account: address, // [!code focus]
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: custom(window.fluent!),
});
```
