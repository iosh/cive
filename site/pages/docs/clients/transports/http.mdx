# HTTP Transport

The `http` Transport connects to a JSON-RPC API via HTTP.

## Import

```ts twoslash
import { http } from "cive";
```

## Usage

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/snippets/publicClient.ts:imports]

const client = createPublicClient({
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http("https://main.confluxrpc.com/..."),
});
```

:::warning[Warning]
If no `URL` is provided, the transport will default to a public RPC URL on the chain. It is recommended to provide an authenticated RPC URL to prevent rate-limiting. You can find more information about [Conflux RPC](https://doc.confluxnetwork.org/docs/core/conflux_rpcs)
:::

## Batch JSON-RPC

The `http` Transport supports Batch JSON-RPC. This means that multiple JSON-RPC requests can be sent in a single HTTP request.

The Transport will batch up Actions over a given period and execute them in a single Batch JSON-RPC HTTP request. By default, this period is a [zero delay](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Event_loop#zero_delays) meaning that the batch request will be executed at the end of the current [JavaScript message queue](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Event_loop#queue). Consumers can specify a custom time period `wait` (in ms).

You can enable Batch JSON-RPC by setting the `batch` flag to `true`:

```ts twoslash
import { http } from "cive";
const transport = http("https://main.confluxrpc.com/...", {
  batch: true, // [!code focus]
});
```

Now when you invoke Actions, the `http` Transport will batch and send over those requests at the end of the message queue (or custom time period) in a single Batch JSON-RPC HTTP request:

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/snippets/publicClient.ts:imports]
const client = createPublicClient({
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http("https://main.confluxrpc.com/..."),
});
// ---cut---
// The below will send a single Batch JSON-RPC HTTP request to the RPC Provider.
const [blcok, balance, status] = await Promise.all([
  client.getBlock(),
  client.getBalance({ address: "cfx:..." }),
  client.getStatus(),
]);
```

## Parameters

The `http` is a re-export of the viem, So you can refer to [Viem](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/transports/http) for information on the parameters.
