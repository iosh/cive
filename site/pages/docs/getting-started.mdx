# Get started

Get started with Cive.

## Quick start

### 1. Set up your Client & Transport

:tada: :100:

```ts twoslash
import { createPublicClient, http } from "cive";
import { mainnet } from "cive/chains";
const client = createPublicClient({
  // [!code focus]
  chain: mainnet, // [!code focus]
  transport: http(), // [!code focus]
}); // [!code focus]
```

:::info
In a production app, it is highly recommended to pass through your authenticated RPC provider URL (see [conflux rpc](https://doc.confluxnetwork.org/docs/core/conflux_rpcs)). If no URL is provided, viem will default to a public RPC provider. [Read more](#TODO).

### 2. Consume Actions

Now that you have a Client set up, you can now interact with Ethereum and consume [Actions](#TODO)!

```ts twoslash
import { createPublicClient, http } from "cive";
import { mainnet } from "cive/chains";

const client = createPublicClient({
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http(),
});

const block = await client.getBlock(); // [!code focus]
```
