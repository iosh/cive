# Get started [Get started with Cive.]
## Overview

Cive is a Typescript interface for the [Conflux Core Space](https://doc.confluxnetwork.org/docs/core/Overview). It is built on viem. If you are working with [Conflux eSpace](https://doc.confluxnetwork.org/docs/espace/Overview), we recommended to use [viem](https://viem.sh/).

## Quick start

### 1. Set up your Client & Transport

```ts twoslash
import { createPublicClient, http } from "cive";
import { mainnet } from "cive/chains";
const client = createPublicClient({
  // [!code focus]
  chain: mainnet, // [!code focus]
  transport: http(), // [!code focus]
}); // [!code focus]
```

:::info
In a production app, it is highly recommended to pass through your authenticated RPC provider URL (see [conflux rpc](https://doc.confluxnetwork.org/docs/core/conflux_rpcs)). If no URL is provided, viem will default to a public RPC provider. [Read more](/docs/actions/public/introduction).

### 2. Consume Actions

Now that you have a Client set up, you can now interact with Conflux core space and consume [Actions](/docs/actions/public/introduction)!

```ts twoslash
import { createPublicClient, http } from "cive";
import { mainnet } from "cive/chains";

const client = createPublicClient({
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http(),
});

const block = await client.getBlock(); // [!code focus]
```
