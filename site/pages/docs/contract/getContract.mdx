# Contract Instances

A Contract Instance is a type-safe interface for performing contract-related actions with a specific ABI and address, created by the `getContract` function.

## Import

```ts
import { getContract } from "cive";
```

## Usage

You can create a Contract Instance with the `getContract` function by passing in a [ABI](#TODO), address, and [Public](/docs/clients/public) and/or [Wallet Client](/docs/clients/wallet). Once created, you can call contract methods, fetch for events, listen to events, etc.

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
import { getContract } from "cive";
import { Abi } from "./abi";
import { publicClient, walletClient } from "./client";

// 1. Create contract instance
const contract = getContract({
  address: "cfx:...",
  abi: Abi,
  // 1a. Insert a single client
  client: publicClient,
  // 1b. Or public and/or wallet clients
  // client: { public: publicClient, wallet: walletClient },
});

// 2. Call contract methods, fetch events, listen to events, etc.
const result = await contract.read.totalSupply();
```

```ts [client.ts] filename="client.ts"
import { createPublicClient, createWalletClient, http, custom } from "cive";
import { mainnet } from "cive/chains";
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "cive/accounts";

export const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http(),
});
const account = privateKeyToAccount("0x...", { networkId: mainnet.id });

export const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http(),
  account,
});
```

```ts [abi.ts] filename="abi.ts"
export const Abi = [
  {
    inputs: [],
    name: "totalSupply",
    outputs: [{ type: "uint256" }],
    stateMutability: "view",
    type: "function",
  },
  {
    name: "Transfer",
    type: "event",
    inputs: [
      {
        indexed: true,
        name: "from",
        type: "address",
      },
      { indexed: true, name: "to", type: "address" },
      {
        indexed: true,
        name: "tokenId",
        type: "uint256",
      },
    ],
  },
] as const;
```

:::

Using Contract Instances can make it easier to work with contracts if you don't want to pass the `abi` and `address` properties every time you perform contract actions, e.g. [`readContract`](/docs/contract/readContract), [`writeContract`](/docs/contract/writeContract), [`estimateContractGasAndCollateral`](/docs/contract/estimateContractGasAndCollateral), etc. Switch between the tabs below to see the difference between standalone Contract Actions and Contract Instance Actions:

```ts [contract-instance.ts]
import { getContract } from "cive";
import { Abi } from "./abi";
import { publicClient, walletClient } from "./client";

const contract = getContract({
  address: "cfx:...",
  abi: Abi,
  client: {
    public: publicClient,
    wallet: walletClient,
  },
});

const balance = await contract.read.balanceOf(["cfx:..."]);
const hash = await contract.write.mint(["cfx:...", 69420n]);
const logs = await contract.getEvents.Transfer();
```

```ts [contract-actions.ts]
import { Abi } from "./abi";
import { publicClient, walletClient } from "./client";

const balance = await publicClient.readContract({
  address: "cfx:...",
  abi: Abi,
  functionName: "balanceOf",
  args: ["cfx:..."],
});
const hash = await walletClient.writeContract({
  address: "cfx:...",
  abi: Abi,
  functionName: "mint",
  args: ["cfx:...", 69420n],
});
```

```ts [abi.ts]
export const Abi = [
  {
    inputs: [],
    name: "totalSupply",
    outputs: [{ type: "uint256" }],
    stateMutability: "view",
    type: "function",
  },
  {
    name: "Transfer",
    type: "event",
    inputs: [
      {
        indexed: true,

        type: "address",
      },
      { indexed: true, name: "to", type: "address" },
      {
        indexed: true,
        name: "tokenId",
        type: "uint256",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    inputs: [
      {
        internalType: "address",
        name: "account",
        type: "address",
      },
    ],
    name: "balanceOf",
    outputs: [
      {
        internalType: "uint256",
        name: "",
        type: "uint256",

    stateMutability: "view",
    type: "function",

  {
    inputs: [
      {
        internalType: "address",
        name: "to",
        type: "address",
      },
      {

:::
:::tip
While Contract Instances are great for reducing code duplication, they pull in multiple contract actions (e.g. `createContractEventFilter`, `estimateContractGasAndCollateral`, `readContract`,`simulateContract`, `writeContract`), so they can be a bit heavier than individual calls. If you only need a couple contract methods and you care about minimizing bundle size to the fullest extent, you may want to use individual calls instead.

## Return Value

Contract instance object. Type is inferred.

Depending on if you create a contract instance with a Public Client, Wallet Client, or both, the methods available on the contract instance will vary.

#### With Public Client

If you pass in a [`publicClient`](/docs/clients/public), the following methods are available:

- [`createEventFilter`](/docs/contract/createContractEventFilter)
- [`estimateContractGasAndCollateral`](/docs/contract/estimateContractGasAndCollateral)
- [`getEvents`](/docs/contract/getContractEvents)
- [`read`](/docs/contract/readContract)
- [`simulate`](/docs/contract/simulateContract)
- [`watchEvent TODO`](#TODO)

#### With Wallet Client

If you pass in a [`walletClient`](/docs/clients/wallet), the following methods are available:

- [`estimateContractGasAndCollateral`](/docs/contract/estimateContractGasAndCollateral)
- [`write`](/docs/contract/writeContract)

## Parameters

### address

- **Type:** [`Address`](#TODO)

The contract address.

```ts
const contract = getContract({
  address: "cfx:..", // [!code focus]
  abi: Abi,
  client: publicClient,
});
```

### abi

- **Type:** [`Abi`](#TODO)

The contract's ABI.

```ts
const contract = getContract({
  address: "cfx:..",
  abi: Abi, // [!code focus]
  client: publicClient,
});
```

### client

- **Type:** [`Client | { public: Client; wallet: Client }`](/docs/clients/public)

The Client used for performing [contract actions](/docs/contract/getContract#return-value).

```ts
const contract = getContract({
  address: "cfx:..",
  abi: Abi,
  client: publicClient, // [!code focus]
});
```

You can also pass in multiple clients (ie. a Wallet Client and a Public Client):

```ts
const contract = getContract({
  address: "cfx:...",
  abi: Abi,
  client: {
    // [!code focus]
    public: publicClient, // [!code focus]
    wallet: walletClient, // [!code focus]
  }, // [!code focus]
});
```
